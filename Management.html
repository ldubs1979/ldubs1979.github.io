					<h2>Class Management</h2>

					<p> It is my goal as an educator to treat classroom behavior as something that needs to be learned. Behavior is a curricular area, like math or reading. If a student is having trouble with classroom behaviors, rather than taking something away from the student or moving a clip down on a chart, I try to create more opportunity for the student to learn the correct behavior. I like to think of my room as a 'home away from home' and that we are a classroom family. During my time in 1st grade my classroom management is a system that relies on mutual rules that the class came up with together, because it is much more meaningful for the students to follow rules that they themselves created. For example, during the first week of school the class and I would sit down and make a chart about what a first grader looks like and sounds like and how they should act. Based on this classroom discussion we then came up with a set of class rules together and everyone signed our "classroom contract". If there were disruptions that occurred during the day I would refer to the contract and provide the student with opportunity to change their actions.If these same disruptions continued to occur I would issue 2 verbal warnings followed by a "time out" where the student would take some time to themselves and think about how their actions had impacted the classroom family. If a time out is issued I would send home a behavior note (see below) to be signed by the parent, this allowed for further communication between home and school. Positive behaviors deserve to be recognized and celebrated as a part of the classroom culture. With this in mind, I make a point to send home positive behavior notes (see below) with students when I see them making contributions to our classroom family with their actions.</p>

					<h2>Filling Their Buckets</h2>

				</footer>
				
				<content>
					<p> In addition to the management system in place, I introduced the concept of bucket filling to the class. To introduce this concept I read <i>How Full Is Your Bucket?<i> For Kids to the class. The book discusses how each person has an invisible bucket over their head. When someone is kind and respectful that fills up their bucket and when someone is mean or uncooperative that can dip from their buckets. After reading the book, the students each made their own bucket and hung them in their locker. I would write notes to the students at the end of the day and put it in their bucket if I noticed that they were being a good friend or doing their best work that day. I used this as a positive reinforcement for good behavior and yet another way to let parents know how their student was performing in class!</p>
