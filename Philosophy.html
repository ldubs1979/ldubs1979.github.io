					<p> I believe that teaching is a life-long learning process and there is always something new to learn or improve upon. I believe it is imperative, as a teacher, to remain open to new ideas and be able to adapt in our ever-changing world. A strong teacher is one who is willing to consider and implement new concepts or ways of teaching, always understanding that no two students are alike. I believe a good teacher is a team player, contributing to the professional learning community within the school.</p>
					<p> I believe in creating a safe and comfortable learning environment. My ultimate objective is to create cohesiveness in the classroom, so that there is a sense of community to which the students can contribute. I want my students to feel at ease in the classroom, that they can ask questions and raise any concerns that may arise. My desire is that students will feel the freedom to think and discover new ideas on their own. It is my goal to help students meet their fullest potential by creating an environment that supports inquiry and critical thinking. All students have the capability for learning and they deserve to be in a classroom that is both engaging and supportive.</p>
					<p> I firmly believe that as a teacher I must show my students respect in order to earn respect from my students. I will help students learn to respect themselves, their classmates, and the world around them. I will teach my students how to be independent, organized, and responsible learners.  I believe the power of a teacher comes from getting to know each of your students on a personal level. I will show compassion towards my students while holding them to a high standard of achievement. </p>
					<p> I am a proponent of engaging and collaborative classroom activities. I think that students perform some of their best work when learning from one another. I want to inspire my students to get excited about learning and to be able to take what I teach them and apply it to their lives outside the classroom. I strive to develop a curriculum that is centered on studentsâ€™ interests in order to promote intrinsic motivation and passion to learn. I will differentiate all of my instruction, as I understand that no two students learn the same way. I also endeavor to implement many kinesthetic, inquiry-based, and technology centered activities in the classroom.</p>
					<p> In order to ensure that my students are passionate, life-long learners, I will lead by example. I will always strive to show my dedication to the success of my students. I hope to instill a love and a desire to learn in my students and I will share my love for learning with them. One of the most important things to me, as an educator is that my students all receive equal opportunities to learn. This means my students will receive what they, as individuals, need to be successful in the classroom. I believe a teacher should strive to foster a love of learning and a sense of confidence in their students so they may succeed in future endeavors. An effective teacher can reach this goal through differentiation and a classroom culture of respect.</p>
