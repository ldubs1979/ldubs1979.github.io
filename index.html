					<p> Welcome to my online teaching portfolio. Above you will find links to my resume with letters of recommendation included, my teaching philosophy, and classroom management techniques. Explore the website a little more and you will find literacy and math lessons I have created and implemented, as well as a section discussing my research. Additionally, there is a section dedicated to technology and its utilization in the classroom. </p>
					<p>I grew up in Geneva, Illinois. In 2010, I graduated from Geneva Community High School. I chose to attend Augustana College to pursue a lifelong dream of becoming a teacher. I chose Augustana College because of the unique community that a small liberal arts college provides as well as for their outstanding Education department. At Augustana, I majored in Elementary Education with a minor in Spanish. I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Elementary Education in the Spring of 2014.</p>
